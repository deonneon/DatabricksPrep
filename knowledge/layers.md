# Different layers

A practical example might help illustrate: In a business intelligence system, the semantic layer would define what "Revenue" means and how it's calculated, the visualization layer would determine how to display revenue trends in a chart, and the presentation layer would handle how that chart's data is formatted and transmitted to the user's browser.

## Semantic Layer

The Semantic Layer sits between raw data and business users, acting as a business-friendly abstraction layer. It translates complex data structures into familiar business terms and metrics that non-technical users can understand. This layer manages business rules, calculations, and metadata, allowing users to analyze data using their own business terminology without needing to understand the underlying technical implementation.

The gold layer data would indeed typically be part of the semantic layer, as it represents business-ready, transformed data with clear business meanings and definitions

## Visualization Layer

The Visualization Layer focuses on how data is visually displayed to users through charts, graphs, dashboards, and other visual elements. It transforms raw data into visual representations that humans can easily understand and interact with. This layer handles aspects like chart types, colors, layouts, and interactive features that help users explore and understand data.

## Presentation Layer

The Presentation Layer primarily handles how information is formatted and delivered to end users. It manages protocols and data formatting for communication, ensuring data can be properly transmitted and received. This layer deals with syntax, data encoding, encryption, and compression - essentially preparing data for transmission across systems.
